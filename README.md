# Bayesian Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization for E-Commerce

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete Bayesian probabilistic forecasting system for e-commerce demand estimation and inventory optimization. It combines hierarchical Bayesian modeling, MCMC inference, and decision theory to quantify demand uncertainty and recommend optimal inventory levels that minimize expected costs.

## Problem Statement

E-commerce businesses face critical inventory management challenges:
- **Overstock**: Leads to storage costs, markdowns, and capital inefficiency
- **Understock**: Causes lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and revenue loss

This project addresses these challenges by building a probabilistic forecasting framework that:
1. Estimates demand distributions for multiple product categories
2. Quantifies forecast uncertainty with credible intervals
3. Recommends optimal inventory levels using decision theory
4. Provides sensitivity analysis for different cost scenarios

## Statistical Methods Applied

### Core Probabilistic and Statistical Techniques

1. **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling**
   - Multi-level structure capturing category-specific and global demand patterns
   - Hyperpriors enable information sharing across categories
   - Flexible framework for incorporating domain knowledge

2. **MCMC Inference (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo)**
   - Posterior sampling via PyMC
   - Convergence diagnostics (Rhat, effective sample size)
   - Efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces

3. **Posterior Predictive Inference**
   - Generating future demand distributions
   - Uncertainty propagation through the model
   - Credible intervals for forecasts

4. **Uncertainty Quantification**
   - Credible intervals for parameters
   - Predictive intervals for future observations
   - Quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty

5. **Decision Theory**
   - Optimal inventory decisions minimizing expected cost
   - Cost function: C(Q) = h*E[max(Q-D,0)] + p*E[max(D-Q,0)]
   - Sensitivity analysis for cost parameters

6. **Bayesian Hypothesis Testing**
   - Posterior probability comparisons across categories
   - Credible intervals for pairwise differences
   - No p-values; direct probability statements

7. **Bootstrap Resampling**
   - Confidence intervals for key performance metrics
   - Non-parametric uncertainty estimation
   - Robustness assessment

## Data Strategy

The project uses **synthetic e-commerce demand data** with realistic characteristics:

- **Time Period**: 365 days of historical data
- **Categories**: 4 product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Sports)
- **Demand Components**:
  - Category-specific baseline demand (100-200 units/day)
  - Linear trend (0.08-0.15 units/day growth)
  - Weekly seasonality (7-day cycle)
  - Monthly seasonality (30-day cycle)
  - Observation noise (12-25 units standard deviation)

Data generation is fully reproducible with fixed random seed.

## Key Results

### Forecast Accuracy
- 60-day probabilistic forecasts with 95% credible intervals
- Category-specific demand patterns captured
- Uncertainty quantification for decision-making

### Inventory Optimization
- Optimal order quantities computed for each category
- Expected cost minimization under uncertainty
- Safety stock levels derived from posterior distributions

### Model Validation
- MCMC convergence achieved (all Rhat < 1.01)
- Effective sample sizes > 1000 for all parameters
- Hierarchical structure enables robust inference

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn pymc arviz
```

### Running the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Bayesian_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb
```

Execute cells sequentially from top to bottom. Each section is self-contained and builds on previous results.

## Expected Runtime
- Full notebook execution: 10-15 minutes
- MCMC sampling (Section 4): 5-8 minutes (most time-consuming)
- All other sections: < 1 minute each

## Key Findings

1. **Demand Heterogeneity**: Categories exhibit distinct demand patterns with different baseline levels, trends, and seasonal amplitudes.

2. **Forecast Uncertainty**: Uncertainty increases with forecast horizon; 95% credible intervals widen over time.

3. **Optimal Inventory**: Recommended inventory levels balance holding costs against stockout penalties; sensitivity to cost parameters is substantial.

4. **Category Differences**: Bayesian hypothesis testing reveals significant demand differences between categories with high posterior probability.

5. **Model Fit**: Hierarchical structure effectively captures both category-specific and global patterns.

## Business Recommendations

1. **Implement Recommended Inventory Levels**: Use optimal order quantities to minimize expected costs.

2. **Monitor Forecast Accuracy**: Compare predictions against actual demand; update model monthly.

3. **Adjust for Cost Parameters**: Sensitivity analysis shows optimal inventory is highly responsive to holding vs. stockout costs.

4. **Category-Specific Strategies**:
   - High-demand categories: Maintain higher safety stock
   - Low-demand categories: Reduce holding costs via just-in-time ordering
   - High-uncertainty categories: Implement more frequent reviews

5. **Incorporate External Factors**: Extend model with promotions, holidays, and competitor actions.

## Future Extensions

1. **Real Data Integration**: Replace synthetic data with actual e-commerce transaction data.

2. **External Covariates**: Incorporate price, promotions, marketing spend, competitor actions.

3. **Longer Forecast Horizons**: Extend beyond 60 days for strategic planning.

4. **Dynamic Pricing**: Integrate demand forecasts with pricing optimization.

5. **Multi-Echelon Inventory**: Extend to supply chain networks.

6. **Real-Time Updates**: Implement online learning with streaming data.

7. **Advanced Models**: Explore non-linear trends, regime-switching, and mixture models.
